## Investment Platform - Backend

This is the backend for an investment platform built using **NestJS** and **Ethereum smart contracts**. The platform allows users to contribute to an investment campaign, claim refunds, and release funds if the goal is met.

### Features:

- User contributions and refunds management.
- Campaign goal tracking.
- Smart contract interaction (Ethereum).
- Admin functionality to release funds if goal is achieved.
- Investor dashboard to track contributions and campaign status.

### Platform Assumptions and Requirements:

- **KYC Verification**: The platform integrates with third-party services such as **VerifyMe** for the validation of users' KYC (Know Your Customer) information before they can participate in the investment campaign.
- **Smart Contract**: The platform interacts with a deployed **Ethereum smart contract**  responsible for managing key processes such as handling contributions, issuing refunds, and releasing funds to the developer once the goal is reached.
- **Infura**: **Infura** is used as the Ethereum node provider to enable the platform to interact with the Ethereum network remotely, ensuring reliable and scalable connectivity without needing to run a dedicated Ethereum node.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information such as **API keys, contract addresses**, and other configuration settings are securely stored in environment variables to protect critical data and ensure the platform's configuration is kept separate from the application code..
